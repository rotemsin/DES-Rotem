DES attempt to crack code with 3 rounds

This Java project is an attempt to crack the key in a DES encryption algorithm. The plaintext and the cyphertext are known. The purpose is to crack the 64-bit key with 3 rounds instead of 16. This project checks all 2^64 possible keys. Therefore, it takes a long time to find the correct key.
